# Spotify_Project

This project involves extracting and analyzing data from the Spotify API. The goal is to explore and understand various endpoints of the Spotify API, retrieve data, and analyze it for insights.

---

## **Initial Goals**

### **Data Extraction**
1. Select and connect to a suitable API (e.g., Spotify API).  
2. Understand API types (e.g., REST API) and how to connect using different authentication methods.  
3. Learn about endpoints and identify those relevant for the project using documentation.  
4. Extract and parse data into readable/tabular formats.  
5. Extract data from multiple endpoints to create a cohesive data model.

## **Current Progress**
### **Learned Concepts:**
- **Role of APIs:** Understand how APIs act as bridges between systems, enabling communication and data exchange.
- **Types of APIs:** Explored REST, SOAP, GraphQL, and other common API types.  
- **URL Components:** Gained knowledge of how URLs are structured for API requests (protocol, base URL, endpoints, parameters).  
- **Anatomy of Request and Response Messages:** Learned about headers, body, status codes, and their roles in API communication.  
- **HTTP Verbs:** Mastered the purpose of methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.

### **Working with Python:**
- **Requests Package:** Familiarized with the Python `requests` library for making API calls.  
- **HTTP Methods in Python:** Sent GET and POST requests using Python.  
- **URL Parameters:** Learned how to add query parameters to API requests.  
- **Headers and Status Codes:** Understood how to work with headers for authentication and identify status codes for response validation.  

### **Authentication:**
- Explored basic authentication methods and API-specific authentication techniques.  

### **Working with JSON Data:**
- **Requesting JSON:** Fetched structured JSON data from APIs.  
- **Sending JSON:** Sent JSON data in POST requests for creating or updating resources.  

### **Error Handling:**
- Learned about connection errors and HTTP errors, including how to manage them in Python.

## **Future Scope**
1. Perform exploratory data analysis on the extracted data.
2. Visualize trends and insights using tools like Python and Tableau.
3. Experiment with advanced features like OAuth authentication (required for Spotify API).  
4. Implement error-handling mechanisms to build robust API integrations.
