# Spotify_Project

This project involves extracting and analyzing data from the Spotify API. The goal is to explore and understand various endpoints of the Spotify API, retrieve data, and analyze it for insights. 

## Initial Goals

1. **Data Extraction**:
   - Select and connect to a suitable API (e.g., Spotify API).  
   - Understand API types (e.g., REST API) and how to connect using different authentication methods.
   - Learn about endpoints and identify those relevant for the project using documentation.  
   - Extract and parse data into readable/tabular formats.
   - Extract data from multiple endpoints to create a cohesive data model.

## Future Scope
- Perform exploratory data analysis on the extracted data.
- Visualize trends and insights using tools like Python and Tableau.

Stay tuned for updates as the project evolves!
