# Spotify_Project

This project involves extracting and analyzing data from the Spotify API. The goal is to explore and understand various endpoints of the Spotify API, retrieve data, and analyze it for insights. The project will evolve daily with updates logged on GitHub.

## **Initial Goals**

### **Data Extraction**
1. Select and connect to a suitable API (e.g., Spotify API).  
   - Explore public APIs: [Public APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis).  
2. Understand different types of APIs (e.g., REST API) and how to connect using various authentication methods.  
3. Learn about endpoints and identify relevant ones for the project using documentation.  
4. Extract and parse data into readable/tabular formats.  
5. Extract data from multiple endpoints to create a cohesive data model.

## **Expanded Scope**
### **API Connection**
- **Platform:** Spotify API.  
- **Tools:** Python and Visual Studio Code (VS Code).  
- **Additional Concepts:**  
  - Error handling during API calls.  
  - Using Dask for efficient data processing.

### **Data Parsing and Modeling**
#### **Key Elements to Extract:**
- **Tracks**: Retrieve details for individual tracks.  
- **Albums**: Gather album information for tracks.  
- **Artists**: Fetch artist details and metadata.  
- **Genres**: Retrieve associated genres for tracks/artists.  
- **Playlists**: Analyze popular playlists and their contents.

#### **Workflow Steps:**
1. **Get a Popular Playlist**:  
   - Extract playlist details.  
2. **Track Information**:  
   - Use the track IDs from the playlist to get detailed information about each track.  
3. **Artist Information**:  
   - Retrieve artist details for all tracks in Step 2.  
4. **Genre Information**:  
   - Extract genres for all tracks/artists in Step 2.  
5. **Album Information**:  
   - Retrieve album details for all tracks in Step 2.  
6. **Audio Features**:  
   - Extract track audio features for further analysis.

### **Data Modeling**
- **Logical Layer:**  
  - Normalize the data to avoid redundancy and establish relationships between elements.  
  - Design a schema for entities like `Tracks`, `Albums`, `Artists`, `Genres`, and `Playlists`.  
- **Physical Layer:**  
  - Build physical tables in a MySQL server.  

---

### **Data Transformation**
1. **File Dumping Ground:**  
   - Save raw API responses as CSV files locally.  
2. **Schema Finalization:**  
   - Model data logically and finalize a schema with table structure and columns.  
3. **Data Transformation Script:**  
   - Use Python to process CSV files, transform the data, and create tables in the MySQL server.

---

## **Future Scope**
1. Perform exploratory data analysis on the transformed data.  
2. Visualize trends and insights using Python and Tableau.  
3. Optimize API calls and implement rate-limiting strategies.  
4. Expand the schema to include additional Spotify data elements if needed.
