# Spotify_Project

This project involves extracting and analyzing data from the Spotify API. The goal is to explore and understand various endpoints of the Spotify API, retrieve data, and analyze it for insights. The project is being developed iteratively, with daily updates logged to reflect learning and progress.

---

## **Initial Goals**

### **Data Extraction**
1. Select and connect to a suitable API (e.g., Spotify API).  
   - Explore public APIs: [Public APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis).  
2. Understand different types of APIs (e.g., REST API) and how to connect using various authentication methods.  
3. Learn about endpoints and identify relevant ones for the project using documentation.  
4. Extract and parse data into readable/tabular formats.  
5. Extract data from multiple endpoints to create a cohesive data model.

## **Current Progress**

### **Day 1: Understanding APIs**
- Learned the **role of APIs** as a bridge for data exchange between systems.  
- Explored **different types of APIs**, including REST, SOAP, and GraphQL.  
- Studied the **anatomy of API request and response messages**, including components like headers, body, and status codes.  
- Understood **URL components**, including base URLs, endpoints, and parameters.  
- Mastered the **four HTTP verbs**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.  

### **Day 2: API Requests with Python**
- Used the `requests` package in Python to:  
  - Send GET and POST requests.  
  - Work with **URL parameters** and **headers**.  
- Explored **status codes** for handling API responses.  
- Practiced **API authentication** methods, including Basic Authentication and API key-based methods.  
- Requested and sent **JSON-formatted data** using Python.  
- Learned about handling common errors like connection errors and HTTP errors.  

### **Day 3: Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**
- Set up the project environment using **VS Code**.  
- Learned key VS Code features:  
  - **Zen Mode:** For distraction-free coding.  
  - **Command Palette:** Quick access to commands and features.  
  - **Minimap:** Visualizing code structure.  
  - **Shortcuts:** Enhancing productivity.  
  - **Emmet and Snippets:** Writing reusable code efficiently.  
  - **Run and Debug:** Testing and debugging Python scripts.  

### **Day 4: Connecting to the Spotify API**

Today, I successfully implemented the process to connect to the Spotify API. This involved:  
- Learning how to obtain an **access token** using the Spotify API's token endpoint.  
- Using **client credentials** for API authentication.  
- Sending a **POST request** to retrieve the token and understanding how to store and use it for subsequent requests.  
- Developing a script to retrieve artist details by making a **GET request** to the Spotify API using the access token.  
- Handling authentication headers and understanding the structure of API responses.  

This marks a significant step towards automating data extraction from the Spotify API for analysis.

## **Updated Scope**
As the project evolves, the following steps have been added:

### **Data Parsing and Modeling**
#### **Key Elements to Extract:**
- **Tracks:** Retrieve details for individual tracks.  
- **Albums:** Gather album information for tracks.  
- **Artists:** Fetch artist details and metadata.  
- **Genres:** Retrieve associated genres for tracks/artists.  
- **Playlists:** Analyze popular playlists and their contents.

#### **Workflow Steps:**
1. **Get a Popular Playlist:** Extract playlist details.  
2. **Track Information:** Use the track IDs from the playlist to get detailed information about each track.  
3. **Artist Information:** Retrieve artist details for all tracks in Step 2.  
4. **Genre Information:** Extract genres for all tracks/artists in Step 2.  
5. **Album Information:** Retrieve album details for all tracks in Step 2.  
6. **Audio Features:** Extract track audio features for further analysis.

### **Data Transformation**
1. **File Dumping Ground:** Save raw API responses as CSV files locally.  
2. **Schema Finalization:** Model data logically and finalize a schema with table structure and columns.  
3. **Data Transformation Script:** Use Python to process CSV files, transform the data, and create tables in a MySQL server.  

---

## **Future Scope**
1. Perform exploratory data analysis on the transformed data.  
2. Visualize trends and insights using Python and Tableau.  
3. Optimize API calls and implement rate-limiting strategies.  
4. Expand the schema to include additional Spotify data elements if needed.  

---

## **What's Next?**
- Begin experimenting with connecting to the Spotify API using Python.  
- Extract sample data and test saving it as CSV.  
- Start building the logical data model and plan the MySQL schema.

Stay tuned for daily updates as the project progresses!
